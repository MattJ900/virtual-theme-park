# ✨Virtual Theme Park✨

## Description
Many aspects of life have changed since the pandemic began, one of which being outlets for fun. Theme parks have been shutdown for over a year now, so we wanted to bring back back the fun in a safe way. With our Virtual Theme Park app, the user is able to navigate through our mock-up of Disneyland. 

When the user first encounters the application, it will be deployed via Heroku. The user will see an image of the Disneyland castle, to which they will follow Tinkerbell and click the shining star to the left of the caslte. Once the user clicks the button, they are moved to the Login page where they can either sign-up if they're a new member, or log-in if they're a returning member.

After the user has signed up of logged-in, they will be redirected to our main-park page which displays a map of Disneyland and the rides in which they can visit. There are four rides from the user to choose from (Star Wars, Space Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean or The Haunted Mansion). If the user wants to pass on the rides and look at our shop, they can click on one of our vendors to view the array of items we have.

Once the user selects a ride, they will be able to view a video of the ride and learn a few new facts about it as well. If the user wishes to ride again, they can replay the video, or if they want to venture to a new ride, they can visit the Fast-Pass(navbar) and select a new ride, a vendor, return to the map or exit the park.
